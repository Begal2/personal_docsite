As a language learner-- I speak Chinese, English and Italian-- I am passionate with great imagination towards life.  
I love communicating in both languages and codes, which makes thoughts💬 sparkling in two important dimensions.  
As an imperfect perfectionist, I am meticulous, patient, logic- and solution- oriented at work. Also, I am a friendly and easy-going person with sense of humor.  

♥️ I am happy you come here and have fun at my website!
