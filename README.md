- 更多好玩的东西还在持续更新中，有任何想要分享的想法，好玩的东西请邮件联系我：gelatissima@yahoo.com
- 来认识我吧！🥳


As a language learner and junior data analyst, I am passionate with great imagination towards life.  
I love communicating in both languages and codes, which makes thoughts💬 sparkling in two important dimensions.  
As an imperfect perfectionist, I am meticulous, patient, logic- and solution- oriented at work. Also, I am a friendly and easy-going person with sense of humor.  

♥️ I am happy you come here and have fun at my website!
